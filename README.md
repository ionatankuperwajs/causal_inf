### Updated 7/10/17
Bayesian inference framework for mapping neural activity and connectivity from in vivo from population activity measurements by calcium imaging combined with cellular resolution optogenetic activity perturbations.

TODO:
  1. Extend Packer data analysis (spike triggered averages)
  2. Fix Gumbel method and nonlinear model
  3. Analyze improved model results
  4. Organize code
  5. Start on Mrsic-Flogel Data
