Bayesian inference framework for mapping neural activity and connectivity from in vivo from population activity measurements by calcium imaging combined with cellular resolution optogenetic activity perturbations.
TODO:
  1. Implement gumbel method
  2. Implement nonlinearity
  3. Refactor code
  4. Run on other data
