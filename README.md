### Updated 6/27/17
Bayesian inference framework for mapping neural activity and connectivity from in vivo from population activity measurements by calcium imaging combined with cellular resolution optogenetic activity perturbations.

TODO:
  1. Fix nonlinear model
  2. Organize code
  3. Extend Packer data analysis
  	Plot perturbations + inferred perturbation artifacts
	Fix baseline (i.e. reconstruction doesn’t capture low data)
	Which neuron/time period are we plotting?
	Placeholder on the entire data set
	Plot different neurons
	Prior on rate to make it sparser
	Average firing rate
	Probability vs. weight (spike/slab) connectivity matrices
	Spontaneous vs. perturbed (both probability and weight) connectivity matrices
   4. Start on Mrsic-Flogel Data
