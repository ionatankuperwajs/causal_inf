### Updated 7/21/17
Bayesian inference framework for mapping neural activity and connectivity from in vivo from population activity measurements by calcium imaging combined with cellular resolution optogenetic activity perturbations.

TODO: 
  1. Train analytical model with new recognition network
  2. Analyze results (as a whole plus restrict to good neurons)
  3. Start on Mrsic-Flogel Data
  4. Organize code
  5. Fix Gumbel method and nonlinear model (Packer data)
